# JD-OldGen
My version of JDWDF-OldGen, used for Just Dance Online Old-Gen, I worked on up to November 2021.

**JD-OldGen** is a mock-up of **Just Dance 2015 to 2018** servers by Ubisoft.

**Just Dance** is a series of dancing-themed games created by Ubisoft back in 2009, these servers are for Just Dance 2015-2018 for Wii.

## Requirements
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- A server to host (duh)
## How to install

- Use `git clone https://github.com/devvjs/jd-oldgen.git` or download the repo as a ZIP file directly.
- Once you are done, go into `jd-oldgen` folder and run `npm i` to install all packages that are required.
- After that, you can run the server by `node ws.js`.
